-- Restore has_pending_request to get_all_communities.
--
-- The private join-request flow is stateful: after a member requests to join a
-- private community, the Explore card must keep reading "Request sent" across
-- reloads instead of offering Join again. get_all_communities carried that
-- column when the flow shipped (20260830000000_private_community_join_requests),
-- but the later recreations of the function dropped it, so the client's
-- `has_pending_request` check was always undefined.
--
-- This rebuilds the function on the current body (from
-- 20261008140000_remove_design_interests, which reads member_count straight off
-- communities) and re-adds the column as a correlated EXISTS on the requester's
-- own pending row.
